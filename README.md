# python_ML_tutorials

Each directory here has a python notebook that was adapted from the Python Machine Learning Cookbook. I decided to write up the tutorials as a  better way to remember and visualize the concepts learned compared to just writing python scripts. All data needed for to recreate the notebooks are also included. 

Python version used was 3.6. If you would like to preview the html python notebooks in browswer without downloading: prepend http://htmlpreview.github.io/? before the link works. 

1. Working with Data and Regressions
