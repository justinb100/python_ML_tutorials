# python_ML_tutorials

Each directory here has a python notebook that was adapted from the Python Machine Learning Cookbook. I decided to write up the tutorials as a  better way to learn, remember, and visualize the concepts compared to just writing python scripts. I have used the Pandas framework for almost all of the examples, which makes it easier to follow compared to using numpy arrays everywhere, and have also included extra analysis and visualizations.

All data needed to recreate the notebooks are included.

Python version used was 3.6. Python packages needed are numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, hmmlearn (#6 only), and neurolab (#7 only).
